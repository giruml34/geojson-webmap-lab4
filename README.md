Lab 4 – Interactive Web Mapping
In this lab, I'm creating an interactive choropleth online map showing state-level population density across the United States. I'll load a local GeoJSON file and add it as a map layer, same as I did in the last lab. I'll also use different colors to show different population density levels, add a title, and add a legend to make the map easier to understand.
