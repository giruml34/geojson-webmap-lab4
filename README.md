Lab 4 – Interactive Web Mapping
In this lab, I’m building an interactive choropleth web map that shows state-level population density across the U.S. I’ll load a local GeoJSON file and add it as a map layer, just like I did in the previous lab. Then I’ll apply different colors to represent different population density values, add a title, and create a legend so the map is easy to understand. The most important part is writing the code that lets me see the specific population density value when I hover over a state.
